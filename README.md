# Open Weather API

The goal for this app is to provide the user with data that helps them decide whether it's a good day to rock climb. Data from Open Weather will be displayed along with a search feature that allows the user to search for a specific location.

## Task List

- [ ] Make a `GET` request to Open Weather from the `/weather` router on your **server**, send the response from Open Weather back to the client
- [ ] Make a `GET` request from your **client** to your `/weather` route, save the response data in Redux
- [ ] Display the weather data on the page including: current temp, precip, humidity, and dew point.

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Implement some of the optional request parameters available when making the Open Weather API request (for example, units)
- [ ] Add an input and button for the user to search for a city. You'll need to get these to your server and incorporated into your Open Weather request!
- [ ] Toggle button for metric vs imperial values
- [ ] Style the page to make it look better
